## Wiki Trip

Wikipedia is a free collaborative encyclopedia which is edited every day by a lot of people all over the world. Did you ever wonder from which country did the contributions come from?

Wiki Trip gives you the oppurtunity to have a simple and effective visualization about the edits on a specific page in a temporal context.

Note: The map displays only anonymous edits because tracing registered users is against Wikipedia's Privacy Policy and because this kind of data is not public.

Wiki Trip is a project of Federico "fox" Scrinzi with contributions by Paolo Massa and Maurizio Napolitano of SoNet@FBK.
