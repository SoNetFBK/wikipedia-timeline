<h3>What is Wiki Trip about?</h3>
<p>Wikipedia is a free collaborative encyclopedia that is edited every day by a
lot of people all over the world. Did you ever wonder from which country did the
contributions come from?</p>
<p>Wiki Trip gives you the oppurtunity to have a simple
and effective visualization about the edits on a specific page through time.</p>
<p>Note: It displays only anonymous edits because tracing registered users is against
<a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy">Wikipedia's Privacy Policy</a> and because this kind of data is not public.</p>
<p>Wiki Trip is a project of <a href="http://autistici.org/fox/">Federico "fox" Scrinzi</a> with contributions by <a href="http://www.gnuband.org">Paolo Massa</a> and <a href="http://de.straba.us/">Maurizio Napolitano</a> of <a href="http://sonet.fbk.eu">SoNet@FBK</a>.</p>

<h3>What are the plots showing?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>History plot</p>
    <p>This plot shows two time series, one for edits made by registered
    users and the other one for anonymous users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edits by country</p>
    <p>This bar plot shows from which countries the anonymous edits
    came from. It visualizes a selection of the top countries that edited
    the page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edits by gender</p>
    <p>This other plot shows wether the edits by regitered users are males
    or females. Note that only a small number of users inside Wikipedia
    specified their gender so this data is not about all the editors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Which data is Wiki Trip using?</h3>
<p>Wiki Trip uses data from <a href="http://toolserver.org">Toolserver</a>.
Using a Toolserver account is possible to access to a restricted copy of
the Wikipedia database.</p>
<p>We developed some simple APIs to retrieve data from the Toolserver database:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://toolserver.org/~sonet/api.php">api.php</a></p>
    <p>Get various stats about a page</p>
    <p>Options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>article: page title</li>
      <li>lang: desidered language (default: en)</li>
      <li>family: wiki family (default: wikipedia)</li>
      <li>year_count: show edit count per month (default: false)</li>
      <li>editors: show unique editors for the page (default: false)</li>
      <li>max_editors: maximum number of editors displayed (only if "editors" option is set)</li>
      <li>anons: show anonymous unique editors (default: false)</li>
      <li>top_ten: show top 10% of editors (default: false)</li>
      <li>top_fifty: top 50 editors (default: false)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="http://toolserver.org/~sonet/api.php?article=London&lang=en&editors&max_editors=5">Example</a><br/><br/></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://toolserver.org/~sonet/api_gender.php">api_gender.php</a>
    <p>Get timestamp and gender for any edit by a registered user that specified his gender on a specific page (might be quite slow)</p>
    <p>Options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>article: page title</li>
      <li>lang: desidered language (default: en)</li>
      <li>family: wiki family (default: wikipedia)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="http://toolserver.org/~sonet/api_gender.php?article=London&lang=en">Example</a><br/><br/></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://toolserver.org/~sonet/api_geojson.php">api_geojson.php</a>
    <p>Get a GeoJSON for anonymous edits on a specific page</p>
    <p>Options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>article: page title</li>
      <li>lang: desidered language (default: en)</li>
      <li>family: wiki family (default: wikipedia)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="http://toolserver.org/~sonet/api_geojson.php?article=London&lang=en">Example</a><br/><br/></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The API's output is in JSON format<br/><br/></p>
<p>The APIs are open source and much code has been taken from
<a href="http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/articleinfo/">Xi!'s articleinfo</a>.
We thank Xi a lot for his awesome work!

<h3>I have a suggestion for improving Wiki Trip. Are you interested?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! You can send suggestions and bug reports at sonet at
fbk dot eu or through <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/volpino/wikipedia-timeline">Github</a>.
And, as Wikipedians puts it,
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold">Be bold</a>! ;)</p>

<h3>What is Wikipedia?</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikipedia.org">The most amazing thing ever</a>! Actually we agree with Randall Munroe of <a target="_blank" href="http://xkcd.com/">Xkcd</a> that it's so easy to end productivity when you enter on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia.org</a> and, <a target="_blank" href="http://xkcd.com/">three Hours of Fascinated Clicking Later</a>, you find yourself having learnt about so many new concepts (but not having your work done ;)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://xkcd.com/214/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_problem_with_wikipedia.png" /></a></p>
<p>What we find amazing is that, at 31 March 2011, 68,943,830 pages (of which, 18,284,271 are articles) have been created by 28,328,543 Wikipedians (of which 4,839 are administrators) with a grand total of 1,095,819,060 edits (<a target="_blank" href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_language_Wikipedias_ordered_by_size#Grand_Total">source</a>)!</p>
<p>If 10 years ago, we would have been to tell you "I think it is possible and it is going to happen that in 2011 the volunteer work of 30 million people will be able to create a free-for-everyone encyclopedic resource whose <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051212/full/438900a.html">quality is comparable with Britannica</a>", you would have laughed at us.</p>
<p>Well, what we like about Wikipedia the most is that it is there to testify and demonstrate that humans can get together to create fantastic commons and resources free for everyone!</p>
